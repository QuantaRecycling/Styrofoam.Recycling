>The process of depolymerizing polystyrene into its monomer, styrene, is called pyrolysis. This involves using high heat and pressure to break down the chemical bonds between each styrene compound. Pyrolysis usually goes up to 430 Â°C.[26] The high energy cost of doing this has made commercial recycling of polystyrene back into styrene monomer difficult.[citation needed]
