>Oh good lord—he's using Xylene, indoors, with no respirator or other PPE.

>Xylene does a great job of dissolving expanded polystyrene; in my own experiments, it was much better than acetone. The acetone resulted in a glob of goo, but xylene gave me the varnish-like product he's demonstrating here.

>I used it to make wood and paper mache sculptures (with porous surfaces) completely impermeable to water, so I could display them outside without them being ruined by the weather. This definitely worked for that; I used a thin solution that soaked deep into the surface and hardened it, then a thicker one that approximated varnish, before painting them. Over the course of seven or eight years they held up well, and only needed to be cleaned and have the paint touched up once a year. I used marine varnish on one sculpture, and still had some water intrusion and damage under the paint layer, so the xylene/polystyrene won that contest.

>However, it's the absolute nastiest stuff to work with—the fumes are terrible, even when you're working with it outside. I upgraded my respirator, and was glad I did; believe me, you do not want to be casual about wearing PPE with this stuff. It'll give you wicked headaches, and make your brain work about as well as the translator did for this video.

>I used enough acetone (or little enough Styrofoam) and got a great result.
>I used it for gluing plastics - mostly polystyrene, with excellent results .
>I never tried ir for a porous-surface sealant , but I'm confident your results were about how it would go - excellent retention , excellent sealant , moderate to poor wear resistance , but yes - a good sealant 👍. I suspect that you're right - the xylene is a better solvent than the acetone , tho .
